# Biochemie---Stryer
Answers to all the end-of-chapter problems in Biochemie - Stryer. This is my main project outside my Job. I've used this textbook to learn biochemistry and German at the same time, so my German answers, particularly early on, are far from perfect. My handwriting is messy and the scans aren't great, so I suggest any interested reader look at the "Selected Samples", which are chosen for their partial legibility.
